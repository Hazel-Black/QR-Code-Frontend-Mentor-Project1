## Overview

For this project I put the skills I've have learned in HTML and CSS to the test. I was compelled to search for my answers and solve problems on my own with no tutorial to follow just because I wanted to know how far I had come in terms of learning. I'm very proud of the obstacles I overcame and I hope you enjoy viewing my work.

## My process

I started with building out the appropriate html tags and content that I would need. I moved into the CSS shortly after. I didn't use any frameworks, just plain HTML and CSS since I am still fairly new to this and I don't know any frameworks yet. I will say I'm very excited to learn them though.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

I learned how to convert a design into code just by looking at it. This is a skill that I have practiced in other tutorials but It was a bit difficult to wrap my mind around in the very beginning.In the end I succeeded and that's all that matters.It also pushed me to learn how to center a div vertically and horizontally and that was super tough. I couldn't understand what stack overflow was suggesting and no other websites were any help but i finally found hubspot and my problem was solved. I also got to practice using media queries which was really cool to see in action as i have never used them outside of a guided tutorial.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    .QR-container{
        width: 300px;
    }
    img{
        width: 300px;
        height: 300px;
    }
    .title{
        font-size: x-large;
    }
    .sub-title{
        font-size: large;
    }
}

 and

   position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

### Continued development

I hope to become more comfortable with using media queries and gain more experience working with flexbox and grid.
