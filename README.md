## Overview
  For this project I put the skills I've have learned in HTML and CSS to the test. I was forced to search for my answers and solve problems on my own with no tutorial to follow. I'm very proud of the obsticles I overcame and I hope you enjoy viewing my work.

## My process
  I started with building out the appropppriate html tags and content that I would need. I moved into the CSS shortly after. I didnt use any frameworks or anything besides HTML and CSS since I am still fairly new to this and I dont know any frameworks yet. I will say I'm very excited to learn them though. 
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 



### What I learned

I learned how to convert a design into code just by looking at it. This is a skill that i have practiced in other tutorials but It a bit difficult to wrap my mind around in the very beginning. in the end i succeded and thats all that matters. i also was forced to learn how to center a div vertically and horizontally and that was supper tough. I couldnt understand what stack overflow was suggesting and no other websites were any help but i finally found hubspot and my problem was solved. I also got to practice using media queries which was really cool to see in action as i have never used them outside of a guided tutorial.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    .QR-container{
        width: 300px;
    }
    img{
        width: 300px;
        height: 300px;
    }
    .title{
        font-size: x-large;
    }
    .sub-title{
        font-size: large;
    }
}
 
 and 

   position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable with using media queries and gaind some more experience with flexbox and grid.
